# Homework 1a

<iframe id="Rozendaal Alternation" src="https://editor.p5js.org/panh/sketches/v3u2F78lq"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`Rozendaal Alternation`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

For this analysis, I‚Äôve chosen ‚ÄúInto Time‚Äù by Rafa√´l Rozendaal.

**Observations:**

The artwork consists of smoothly shifting gradient colors.

It appears to be a grid-based composition.

The color transitions seem dynamic and continuous over time.

It gives a sense of infinite movement even though the shapes remain static.

**HOW IT MIGHT WORK**

**Grid Structure:**

The artwork likely uses nested loops to create a grid of rectangular shapes.

**Color Transitions:**

The colors smoothly transition between two or more hues.

This could be achieved using lerpColor() to interpolate between colors over time.

**Animation:**

The colors change continuously, suggesting they are updated using frameCount.

A time-based function (sin(), cos(), or noise()) could control color variation.

**Interaction:**

Some of Rozendaal‚Äôs works react to mouse movements.

This might involve using mouseX or mouseY to modify colors or grid placement.

**üìå Step 5: Useful Resources**

üîπ p5.js Reference


for loops ‚Äì for creating a grid.

lerpColor() ‚Äì for gradual color transitions.

sin() & cos() ‚Äì for smooth animations.

OpenProcessing ‚Äì to explore similar sketches.

p5.js Discord ‚Äì for feedback & debugging.

The Coding Train ‚Äì great video tutorials.


## Homework 1b

üéØ Implementing a Concept: lerpColor() in a Grid


Based on my discussions, I decided to focus on color interpolation (lerpColor()), which Emma suggested was key to Rozendaal‚Äôs smooth transitions.

Here‚Äôs my p5.js sketch implementing this concept:

<iframe id="lerpColor" src="https://editor.p5js.org/panh/sketches/f4a6UMjxX"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`lerpColor`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
    </script>

   **How the Code Works:**

‚úî Nested for loops create the grid of squares.

‚úî lerpColor() smoothly blends colors from pink to blue.

‚úî The time variable (t) controls the color shift, ensuring each square updates uniquely.

## Homework 2a

My AT1 project is a digital emotional support companion designed to be visually soft, playful, and interactive.

**Cute Visuals:** Soft & Expressive

Example: Blobby characters with big, blinking eyes.

Technique: Rounded shapes, smooth gradients, and eye movement for expressiveness.

**Cute Sounds:** Playful & Gentle

Example: Tiny "boop" sounds when clicked.

Technique: High-pitched, short sound effects using p5.sound.

**Cute Interactions:** Fun & Engaging

Example: Blobs wobble when clicked and follow the cursor.

Technique: Subtle size changes and smooth movement animations.

**Plan for AT1**

A friendly, responsive creature that reacts to clicks, blinks, and moves softly‚Äîoffering a comforting digital presence.

## Homework 2b

**Who is My Kindred Spirit?**

My kindred spirit is an emotional support animal‚Äînot a physical one, but a digital presence. Just like real support animals bring comfort and joy, my p5.js project is designed to be an interactive, playful, and soothing experience.

**Context of Our Kinship**

We share a bond of care and companionship. Whether through soft movements, vibrant colors, or responsive interactions, this digital creature exists to bring a sense of warmth and ease.

**Our Common Purpose**

To create a calming, interactive digital companion that engages through motion, sound, and playfulness‚Äîbringing small moments of joy, just like an emotional support animal would.
